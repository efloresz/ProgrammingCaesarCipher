# Programming Caesar's Cipher
This program is to encrypt or decrypt a secret message using the Caesar cipher.

# Purpose
* The purpose of this program is to encrypt or decrypt a user's secret message using the Caesar cipher. The user provides a message, a key (which is a number from 0 to 25), and specifies whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the message. The program then applies the Caesar cipher algorithm to the message and returns the resulting message to the user. 

### Project Requirements

* Python Programming: I gained experience using the Python programming language to create a functional Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption program. This included learning about Python syntax, data types, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

* Cryptography Concepts: Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of cryptography concepts such as substitution ciphers and encryption/decryption algorithms.

* String manipulation: the project requires manipulating strings by finding the index of a character, slicing strings, concatenating strings, and converting between uppercase and lowercase.

* User input validation: the project requires validating user input to ensure that the message only contains allowed characters and that the key is within the valid range.

* Debugging and Troubleshooting: While working on this project, I honed my problem-solving skills and learned how to debug and troubleshoot errors in my code using various tools and techniques.

* Collaboration and Version Control: I gained experience working collaboratively on a coding project, including using version control tools such as Git to manage changes and merge code contributions.

* Testing and Quality Assurance: To ensure that my code was working properly and efficiently, I conducted thorough testing and quality assurance checks, including running automated test scripts and manually testing edge cases.

* Technical Documentation: I created clear and concise technical documentation for my project, including a README file that explained how to use the program, its purpose and features, and any installation or configuration requirements.
